### problem definition

the main problem we are trying to solve.
Building a component library, which works with anything

anything = you throw css, scss , tailwind, chakra or whatever dingy things

this component library or framework or whatever you call it for now,
it should have powers of storybook as well as rollup, so folks can just use and import it too!

we want developer experience to be as smooth as butter with setting up css things
